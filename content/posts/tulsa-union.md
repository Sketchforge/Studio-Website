Tulsa Union's Tuttle Stadium is a Metaverse space created by [Relevant VR](https://relevantvr.com/) and hosted on [Spatial.io](https://www.spatial.io/). I was the lead developer for the project and implemented the majority of the minigames and other functionality.

The stadium was modeled, optimized, and lit for the web-based platform, Spatial.io, and used a variety of techniques to portray the stadium realistically to the real stadium.
