Kitty City is an Augmented Reality Project hosted by the [New Mexico Museum of Art - Vladem Contemporary](https://www.nmartmuseum.org/vladem-contemporary/){: target="_blank"} that is based on [Judy Chicago's Kitty City](https://judychicago.com/gallery/kitty-city/kc-artwork-2/). I was the lead developer on the project at the [VAST Lab]({{site.url}}/vast-lab/){: target="_blank"}, and worked on bringing the virtual cat models and animations into Unity for augmented reality on the Meta Quest Pro.

<br>

The project was awarded a
[silver medal in the Davey Awards](https://daveyawards.com/winners-area/gallery/list/?search=relevantvr&event=1066&award=2){: target="_blank"}
in the Emerging Tech category for virtual and immersive experiences in augmented reality.

Once the cats were modeled, rigged, and animated, the setup process in Unity required a custom solution for handling how the rig was exported from Maya, [mentioned in this posting]({{site.url}}/projects/maya-python-qt-tools/){: target="_blank"}.

To make the cats able to walk around the room in augmented reality, a floor plan of the gallery had to be constructed and match to the real world. Spatial anchors were used to store the location of the gallery for the experience.
